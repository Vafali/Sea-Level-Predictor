# Sea-Level-Predictor

Analyze a data set of global mean sea level change since 1880. Use the data to predict sea level change up to 2050.

Use the data to complete the following tasks:

1) Import data from epa-sea-level.csv using Pandas.

2) Using matplotlib, create a scatterplot using the Year column as the x-axis and the CSIRO-corrected sea level column as the y-axis.

3) Use the linear regression function from scipy.stats to find the slope and y-intercept of the line of best fit. Draw the line of best fit over the scatterplot. Draw a line by 2050 and project sea level rise in 2050.

4) Plot a new line of best fit using data from 2000 to the most recent year in the data set. A line is drawn through 2050 to project sea level rise by 2050 if the rate of rise remains the same as after 2000.

5) The x label should be 'Year', the 'y' label should be 'Sea Level' (in inches), and the title should be 'Sea Level Rise'.
